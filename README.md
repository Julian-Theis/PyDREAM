# PyDREAM
PyDREAM is a Python implementation of the Decay Replay Mining (DREAM) approach and the corresponding predictive algorithms (NAP and NAPr) similar to the ones described in the paper [Decay Replay Mining to Predict Next Process Events](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8811455) and is based on [PM4Py](http://pm4py.org/). The original Java implementation used for benchmarking can be found [here](https://github.com/Julian-Theis/DREAM-NAP). There exists also a ProM plugin [here](https://prominentlab.github.io/ProM-DREAM/). 

# How-To
Please see [example.py](example.py) for an end-to-end example.

## Prerequisites
PyDREAM requires an event log and a corresponding PNML Petri net file, both imported through PM4Py.
```python
from pm4py.objects.log.importer.xes import importer as xes_importer
from pm4py.objects.petri.importer import importer as pnml_importer

log = xes_importer.apply('YOUR_EVENTLOG.xes')
net, initial_marking, _ = pnml_importer.apply("YOURPETRINET.pnml")
```

## Event Logs
The event log must be wrapped into a PyDREAM LogWrapper instance.
```python
from pydream.LogWrapper import LogWrapper
from pm4py.objects.log.importer.xes import importer as xes_importer

log = xes_importer.apply('YOUR_EVENTLOG.xes')
log_wrapper = LogWrapper(log)
```

If you plan on using resources, for example to train a NAPr model, provide the relevant resource identifiers.
```python
log_wrapper = LogWrapper(log, resources=["IDENTIFIER"])
```

## Decay Function Enhancement
The loaded Petri net can be enhanced as described in the paper as described subsequently. An *EnhancedPN* instance will automatically detect if a given *LogWrapper* objects encompasses resources.
```python
from pydream.EnhancedPN import EnhancedPN

enhanced_pn = EnhancedPN(net, initial_marking)
enhanced_pn.enhance(log_wrapper)
enhanced_pn.saveToFile("YOURENHANCEDPN.json")
```

## Decay Replay
Timed State Samples through Decay Replay can be obtained by replaying an event log wrapped into an *LogWrapper* instance on the enhanced Petri net. The function returns two values. 
First, the resulting Timed State Samples in JSON format that can be saved to file directly. Second, a list of TimedStateSample instances that can be used for further processing. The Timed State Samples will contain resource counters if a given *LogWrapper* objects encompasses resources.
```python
import json
from pydream.LogWrapper import LogWrapper
from pydream.EnhancedPN import EnhancedPN
from pm4py.objects.petri.importer import importer as pnml_importer
from pm4py.objects.log.importer.xes import importer as xes_importer

log = xes_importer.apply('YOUR_EVENTLOG.xes')
log_wrapper = LogWrapper(log)

net, initial_marking, _ = pnml_importer.import_net("YOURPETRINET.pnml")
enhanced_pn = EnhancedPN(net, initial_marking, decay_function_file="YOURENHANCEDPN.json")

tss_json, tss_objs = enhanced_pn.decay_replay(log_wrapper=log_wrapper)
with open("timedstatesamples.json", 'w') as f:
        json.dump(tss_json, f)
```

To replay also resources, call *decay_replay()* by listing all resources identifier that should be considered. 
```python
log_wrapper = LogWrapper(log, resources=["IDENTIFIER"])
tss_json, tss_objs = enhanced_pn.decay_replay(log_wrapper=log_wrapper, resources=["IDENTIFIER"])
```

## Next trAnsition Prediction (NAP)
A *NAP* or *NAPr* predictor can be trained in the following way.
```python
from pydream.predictive.nap.NAP import NAP

algo = NAP(tss_train_file="timedstatesamples.json", tss_test_file="timedstatesamples.json", options={"n_epochs" : 100})
algo.train(checkpoint_path="model-path", name="MODEL-NAME", save_results=True)
```


The corresponding model will be stored automatically based on the provided *checkpoint_path* and *name* parameters. The implemented options include:
* "seed" : int
* "n_epochs" : str
* "n_batch_size" : int
* "dropout_rate" : float
* "eval_size" : float
* "activation_function" : str

One can load a trained model from file in the following way.
```python
algo = NAP()
algo.loadModel(path="model-path", name="MODEL-NAME")
```

The following function predicts the next events by returning the raw NAP output and the event names in string format.
```python
from pydream.util.TimedStateSamples import loadTimedStateSamples

tss_loaded_objs = loadTimedStateSamples("timedstatesamples.json")
nap_out, string_out = algo.predict(tss_loaded_objs)
```

# Requirements
PyDREAM is developed for Python 3.7 and is based on PM4Py v2.1.2. NAP and NAPr require tensorflow 2.4.0. The full list of requirements can be found in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).
